# Academic Website for Senior Researchers

Most academic website templates are built for simplicity — a single page, a short bio, and a list of papers. That works for early-career researchers, but falls short for senior researchers who need to present a full body of work: multiple research directions, a growing publication record, an active team, ongoing courses, and project portfolios with rich media.

This template is built specifically for that audience.
