 *   2. Change `src` to '/images/profile.jpg'
 *   3. Change `alt` to the person's name
 *
 * PORTRAIT ORIENTATION RECOMMENDED (taller than wide).
 * The photo is displayed at 180 × 200 px and automatically cropped from the

 * Any file size or resolution works — the site handles resizing.

    Dr. Shaoyu Cai (蔡绍禹) is a Lecturer at the Engineering Design and Innovation Centre, 
    College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, where he also serves as Co-director of 
     <InlineLink href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/immersiverealitylab/"external> NUS Immersive Reality Lab</InlineLink>. He received his Ph.D. from the School of Creative Media at City University of Hong Kong. 
    His research bridges engineering, computing, and design to develop intelligent interactive systems that enhance 
    how people perceive and interact with the physical and digital worlds. His work focuses on wearable technologies, 
    haptic interfaces, multimodal interaction, and extended reality (XR), combining human perception with innovative 
    hardware and software design to create more natural, immersive, and effective human–computer interactions.

// ── 2. RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ──────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Each entry creates one research-direction block (H2 title + description + project images).
 * You can add or remove entries freely.
 *
 * How project pages are created:
 *   1. Add a project below with a title and imageSrc.
 *   2. The image appears on the About page.
 *   3. Clicking the image automatically opens a project detail route generated
 *      from the title. Example: "Project Alpha" -> "/projects/project-alpha".
 *   4. The generated detail page currently shows the project title and
 *      "Project detail page coming soon."
 *
 * projects[].title    -> label shown below the image. Keep titles unique.
 * projects[].imageSrc -> place your image in public/images/ and write "/images/filename.jpg"
 *                        Up to 5 projects are shown per row (2 columns on mobile).
 * projects[].href     -> optional advanced override. Most projects do not need this.
