        This course aims to explore the limitless potential of interactive wearables — 
        from virtual and augmented reality to smart textiles and artificial intelligence-based 
        health-monitoring devices and immersive gaming gear. In this course, students will 
        learn about designing wearable interfaces for seamless interaction among wearables, 
        users, and environments; experimenting with sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, 
        and artificial intelligence-driven applications; and leveraging hardware and software 
        for wearable system prototyping. After completing this course, students should be able 
        to apply interactive wearable technologies to tackle real-world projects, turning ideas 
        into tangible solutions for various applications such as virtual and augmented reality, 
        gaming, fashion, communication, and beyond.

        CDE3301 Ideas to Proof-of-Concept is a two-semester project course which focuses on conceptualisation, 
        implementation and realisation of a product solution to solve an identified problem while providing 
        experience in an integrated product design and development process where technology plays a central role. 
        Through lecture classes, studio sessions and an open-ended project, students learn how to create a product 
        idea to address a problem of interest, generate and evaluate concept designs, and build proof-of-concept 
        prototypes for user testing. Students also learn how to work in a multidisciplinary team and with various 
        stakeholders.
