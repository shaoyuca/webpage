        This course aims to explore the limitless potential of interactive wearables — 
        from virtual and augmented reality to smart textiles and artificial intelligence-based 
        health-monitoring devices and immersive gaming gear. In this course, students will 
        learn about designing wearable interfaces for seamless interaction among wearables, 
        users, and environments; experimenting with sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, 
        and artificial intelligence-driven applications; and leveraging hardware and software 
        for wearable system prototyping. After completing this course, students should be able 
        to apply interactive wearable technologies to tackle real-world projects, turning ideas 
        into tangible solutions for various applications such as virtual and augmented reality, 
        gaming, fashion, communication, and beyond.

        CDE3301 Ideas to Proof-of-Concept is a two-semester project course which focuses on conceptualisation, 
        implementation and realisation of a product solution to solve an identified problem while providing 
        experience in an integrated product design and development process where technology plays a central role. 
        Through lecture classes, studio sessions and an open-ended project, students learn how to create a product 
        idea to address a problem of interest, generate and evaluate concept designs, and build proof-of-concept 
        prototypes for user testing. Students also learn how to work in a multidisciplinary team and with various 
        stakeholders.

      This final year project course is the culmination of a student's learning journey in the Innovation & Design Programme. 
      In this course, students will learn how to apply and integrate knowledge and skills acquired from preceding courses to 
      pursue an area of innovation in a design or research project. The project may be a continuation or extension of a 
      preceding one to deliver an integrated, improved, and optimised solution to the original problem of interest, 
      or a fresh project that arises from a new design problem or research question. Students are expected to 
      demonstrate a high level of independent inquiry in their project, while at the same time working effectively 
      with their project team members and mentors.
